Mousharaka graphic design conference was the first of its kind in Doha. Hired by Virginia Commonwealth University to execute the website for the conference

We designed dual language interface (Arabic/English), and interfaced with online conference paper manager.

In addition to implementation, I arranged secure hosting for the site. 

Menu structures for both English and Arabic content were fine tuned here, to ensure they made sense and provided good wayfinding for both audiences.
