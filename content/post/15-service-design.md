## Catering in the Royal Parks 
A student group project aimed to discover novel ways of providing better catering while using existing facilities in London's Royal Parks. 

Our brief was to find more diverse ways to offer catering services and to support users to make more effective use of them. 

### Ethnography
To inform this project users were observed, documented and engaged regarding why they were there and how they intended to spend time in the park.

</div>

Idea generation techniques used included constraint removal and modelling. Many ideas were generated through these exercises, some were novel and useful.  

## Novely and Utility

The best ideas were examined on how useful and how novel they were. Those which were both were most likely to be adopted.

### Scenario Sketching with Remote Tools

In this scenario a family goes to the park and uses a smart map near the entrance to identify available catering services and see what the wait time is for each.
