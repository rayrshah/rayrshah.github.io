Originally intended to publish hundreds of pages of cirriculum material for teachers only, City Technology's website developed into an interactive, video-first instructional site with a secion specifially designed for kids.

I devised a simplified user input interface for adding text, video and image data. It allows for drag-and-drop arranging/re-arranging of elements once they have been added to the page.
