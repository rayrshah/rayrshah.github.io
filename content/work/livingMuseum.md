The Living Museum program turns children into museum curators complete with an exhibition (typically in a school hall for one afternoon).

This tool leaves a more lasting impression that can be shared with friends and family even after the event has concluded.  The software allows students to document their own artefacts from objects in their family, and their teachers to construct a complete exhibition sub-site.

In addition to scaffolding the exhibition for the children, interfaces were devised for their teachers and museum administrators. Site layout and page flow kept as simple as possible, with streamlined worflows for the three user types. Data relationships were kept as simple as possible.
