<p>Mousharaka graphic design conference was the first of its kind in Doha. Hired by Virginia Commonwealth University to execute the website for the conference</p>

<p>We designed dual language interface (Arabic/English), and interfaced with online conference paper manager.</p>

<p>In addition to implementation, I arranged secure hosting for the site.</p>

<p>Menu structures for both English and Arabic content were fine tuned here, to ensure they made sense and provided good wayfinding for both audiences.</p>
