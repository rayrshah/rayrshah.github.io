<p>A student group project aimed to discover novel ways of providing better catering while using existing facilities in London&rsquo;s Royal Parks.</p>

<p>Our brief was to find more diverse ways to offer catering services and to support users to make more effective use of them.</p>

<p>To inform this project users were observed, documented and engaged regarding why they were there and how they intended to spend time in the park.</p>
