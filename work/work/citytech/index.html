<p>Originally intended to publish hundreds of pages of cirriculum material for teachers only, City Technology&rsquo;s website developed into an interactive, video-first instructional site with a secion specifially designed for kids.</p>

<p>I devised a simplified user input interface for adding text, video and image data. It allows for drag-and-drop arranging/re-arranging of elements once they have been added to the page.</p>
