      <description>Originally intended to publish hundreds of pages of cirriculum material for teachers only, City Technology&amp;rsquo;s website developed into an interactive, video-first instructional site with a secion specifially designed for kids.
I devised a simplified user input interface for adding text, video and image data. It allows for drag-and-drop arranging/re-arranging of elements once they have been added to the page.

      <description>The Living Museum program turns children into museum curators complete with an exhibition (typically in a school hall for one afternoon).
This tool leaves a more lasting impression that can be shared with friends and family even after the event has concluded. The software allows students to document their own artefacts from objects in their family, and their teachers to construct a complete exhibition sub-site.
In addition to scaffolding the exhibition for the children, interfaces were devised for their teachers and museum administrators.</description>

      <description>Lowy specialises in fine art antique and reproduction frames. They work with top galleries and museums in New York and across the world. Their clients are often very busy, and once they have aquired a work of art, they simply want a frame that fits their decor, budget and the work of art itself.
Starting with high-quality capture of frames (through a SLR camera) and virtual compositing of customers’ works of art with Lowy’s frames.</description>

      <description>Mousharaka graphic design conference was the first of its kind in Doha. Hired by Virginia Commonwealth University to execute the website for the conference
We designed dual language interface (Arabic/English), and interfaced with online conference paper manager.
In addition to implementation, I arranged secure hosting for the site.
Menu structures for both English and Arabic content were fine tuned here, to ensure they made sense and provided good wayfinding for both audiences.</description>
